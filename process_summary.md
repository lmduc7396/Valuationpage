# Valuation App Update Summary

## Work Completed
- Added a sidebar control for minimum market-cap filtering and surfaced the number of companies used in calculations.
- Refactored downstream filtering so all calculations honour the selected market-cap floor across charts, tables, and drilldowns.
- Replaced deprecated Streamlit sizing arguments with compatibility helpers to avoid keyword warnings while keeping responsive layouts.
- Iteratively optimised `load_valuation_universe`/`load_market_data` to push the market-cap filter into the SQL query and post-load guardrails, ensuring only qualifying tickers remain.
- Added contextual captions showing the smallest and median market caps (in billions) among included companies for quick validation.

## Persisting Issue
- The app continues to raise `pandas.errors.DatabaseError` when executing the latest query through `pd.read_sql`. The Streamlit logs redact the exact SQL Server error message, so the root cause is still unknown. The failure occurs inside the database call (`utilities/data_access.py:_load_dataframe`) when retrieving the filtered dataset with the current market-cap threshold.

To resolve the remaining error we likely need direct access to the SQL Server logs or to rerun the query outside Streamlit (e.g., via SSMS) to inspect the full database error message.
