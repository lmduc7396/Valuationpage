# Valuation App Update Summary

## Work Completed
- Added a sidebar control for minimum market-cap filtering and surfaced the number of companies used in calculations.
- Refactored downstream filtering so all calculations honour the selected market-cap floor across charts, tables, and drilldowns.
- Replaced deprecated Streamlit sizing arguments with compatibility helpers to avoid keyword warnings while keeping responsive layouts.
- Iteratively optimised `load_valuation_universe`/`load_market_data` to push the market-cap filter into the SQL query and post-load guardrails, ensuring only qualifying tickers remain.
- Added contextual captions showing the smallest and median market caps (in billions) among included companies for quick validation.
- Reconciled the unit mismatch by setting `MARKET_CAP_BILLION_TO_DATA_SCALE = 1000`, so a slider value in billions is compared correctly against the SQL data (stored in millions). The default sidebar floor is restored to 4,000 bn.

## Current Status
- Market-cap gating now excludes sub-threshold tickers (e.g., L18) and the eligible-universe count contracts as expected when increasing the floor (4,000 â†’ 10,000, etc.).
- Manual debug instrumentation used during diagnosis has been removed from the UI and data-access layer.
- No database errors have reappeared since aligning the units; continue monitoring Streamlit logs during higher thresholds to confirm stability.
